The dataset contains different phones specifications like its brand, processor company, processor type, display, Ram, Generation, Front camera. Based on these specifications the price of the mobile is predicted. The dataset contains the numerical values as the dataset is manually preprocessed so that the results are more accurate. Here among the different regression techniques the best technique is evaluated based on the regression evaluation metrics. The best technique that obtained is random forest. So the random forest is taken for the final evaluation. Using the streamlit an interface is created where the users will give the specifications of the mobile and then the price of that phone is predicted based on that specifications
